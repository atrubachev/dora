Kea example configuration file to load subnets can be found by name
 [kea-simple.conf](kea-simple.conf).

## Requirements

Database - any compatible with [GORM](http://gorm.io/)

## Overview

Dora is a service which gather data about database assets from BMCs
 via HTTP\SSH and give ability to retrieve that data via REST API.

List of supported assets can be found in [bmclib](https://github.com/bmc-toolbox/bmclib#data-collection-support) Readme.

### Architecture

#### Server

Dora web server provides API for querying the data which Dora collected.

#### Worker

Worker consumes jobs issued by `publish` command, perform them and
 write results to database.

There are two type of jobs:

* `collect`: collects hosts found by the scanner or collect a given list of hosts
 (fast operation, except for Dell servers)
* `scan`: scan networks found in kea config or a list of given networks (slow operation)

In case you run these jobs as commands to dora, it works as a worker who received 
the command.
